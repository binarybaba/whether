# Handelsweather

An app which let's you see the weather of any location on the planet.
> Powered by Tomorrow.io and Maps.co


### Run locally
- Get your Api key from [Tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/)
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (yarn/npm might work)
- clone this repo
- copy the `.env.template` into a `.env` file and paste your API key
- `pnpm start` (or `yarn start`/ `npm run start`)

> Be mindful of developing in watch mode.
> Tomorrow.io is very sensitive to rate-limits. I know how I walked on eggshells to make this app.

### Tests 
Not the best in class but there are minimal tests added which I thknk should be there at the least
